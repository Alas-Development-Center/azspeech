This process is designed to ensure that access is granted to legitimate academic and research entities committed to ethical and responsible use of the dataset.



### Collection and Pre-processing

In the collection process for the AzSpeech dataset, all voice recordings have been sourced exclusively from public domains. Throughout this meticulous process, the Alas Development Center has adhered to international laws and regulations concerning data privacy, intellectual property rights, and ethical use of digital content. This adherence ensures that the dataset complies with global standards, safeguarding the interests of individuals and entities involved while fostering innovation and research in voice technology.
Recognizing the importance of data quality for effective model training and research, we have undertaken a comprehensive preprocessing and denoising procedure to ensure the dataset provides ready data for users. This means the data is ready for immediate use in a range of applications, from fine-tuning text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition models to academic research.


Quality Assurance: Each voice file has undergone rigorous quality checks to ensure clarity and usability. This includes verifying the audio quality and ensuring the spoken content matches associated transcriptions.

Denoising: With advanced audio processing techniques, background noise has been significantly reduced in each recording. This denoising process enhances the purity of the voice data, making it more effective for training models that can distinguish nuanced vocal features.

Normalization: Audio files have been normalized to maintain consistent volume levels across the dataset. This standardization is crucial for avoiding bias towards louder or quieter recordings during model training.
